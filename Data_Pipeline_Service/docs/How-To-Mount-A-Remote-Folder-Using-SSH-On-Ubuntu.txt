Connecting to a server across the internet is much more secure using SSH. There
is a way that you can mount a folder on a remove server using the SSHFS service.

There are quite a few steps that you’ll have to follow, so get ready and open a
terminal window.

First we’ll install the module:

    sudo apt-get install sshfs

Now we will use the modprobe command to load it

    sudo modprobe fuse

We’ll need to set up some permissions in order to access the utilities. Replace
<username> with your username.

    sudo adduser <username> fuse

    sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse

    sudo chmod +x /dev/fusermount

Since we’ve added ourselves to a user group, we need to logout and back in at this
point before we continue.

Now we’ll create a directory to mount the remote folder in. I chose to create it in
my home directory and call it remoteserv.

    mkdir ~/remoteserv

Now we have the command to actually mount it. You’ll be prompted to save the server
key and for your remote password.

    sshfs <username>@<ipaddress>:/remotepath ~/remoteserv

Now you should be able to cd into the directory and start using it as if it was local.

geek@ubuntuServ:~/remoteserv$ ls -l
